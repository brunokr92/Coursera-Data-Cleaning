# Coursera-Data-Cleaning

The following code was performed to clean and get insight of the accelorometer inside a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. It was used to extract a tidy data set with the average and variance of each measurement coming from the accelorometer. 

The data was extracted from:
-X_test.txt
-Y_test.txt
-subject_test.txt
-X_train.txt
-Y_train.txt
-subject_train.txt
-features.txt
-activity_labels.txt

The data concatinates the test and the training data within one merged dataset. It also has more descriptive column names as well as more appropriate strings for the activity variable. The final table was organized and grouped up by the activity being performed and the subject performing it. The final table is written as a text file and it is loaded into the UCI HAR Dataset directory
